My first game I've ever created. It was actually my final project back in my technical school. It's very basic and the code is a pure mess. And yes it's only in Polish, so I'm sorry for all you folks there that cant understand a single thing in this game. In short, it's like an adventure-type game when you get a brief description of where you are located and you get to choose what you gonna do.
